CodeSprint is an iOS application coming to the Appstore soon (awaiting approval). More features will be developed and released such as Burndown Charts. I was inspired to make this app because of my undergraduate experience as a CS student. There was no way to hold students accountable when they did not complete their assigned tasks in group projects. Many college students are practicing something similar to the "SCRUM" model but it is done inefficiently. I came to realize that every two weeks in school when you were assigned a new program, it is similar to the concept of a "Sprint". Due to the lack of project management, poor breakdown of tasks and lack of SCRUM meetings, students do not feel the "truth-seeking" pressure from SCRUM meetings and efficent task management. Hence, I created CodeSprint to help developers/student developers to bring SCRUM into their workflow, either in the classroom or for personal projects.

This app is completely free, with no ads. I just hope my app would help someone out there that has been in my position before.

CodeSprint: Task-Management
-------------

CodeSprint is **"SCRUM"-based**, where there is a Product Backlog, a Sprint Backlog, along with Active Sprints. There is also Group Messaging. In the future I will include Burn-Down Charts to help figure out reasons for why the team did not meet deadlines. 

> **Note:**

> - CodeSprint currently requires either GitHub sign-in or Facebook sign-in. (No longer requires this)
> - More features to be developed and to come after released.

> **The Sprint Menu for the team is broken into 3 parts:**

> - 1. Product Backlog: add all the project spec/requirements here.
> - 2. Sprint Backlog: add all the tasks needed to meet all the specifications.
> - 3. Active Sprints: create new sprints with a specific deadline. Import the goals from the sprint backlog by pressing the + button, and mark them as complete as you go.

Remarks:
--------------------
> **There are three golden rules of CodeSprint: ALWAYS!!, ALWAYS!! CHECK IN WITH YOUR TEAM:**

> - What did you do yesterday?
> - What will you do today?
> - Did you run into any issues?

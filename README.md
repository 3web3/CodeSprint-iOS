Welcome to CodeSprint!
===================

This iOS application coming to the AppStore soon. More features would be developed after CodeSprint's release. I was inspired to make this app due to the fact that during my undergrad I had unproductive partners during my CS curriculum. I felt as though many college students are doing something similar to the "SCRUM" model, but inefficiently. I came to realize that every two weeks in school when you were assigned a new program, it is similar to the concept of a "Sprint". Due to lack of management, and breakdown of tasks and SCRUM meetings, partners tend to feel the easiness to slack off without the "truth-seeking" pressure from SCRUM meetings and efficient tasks management. Hence, I created CodeSprint and will continue to improve this project.

This app is completely free, with no ads. I just hope my app would help someone out there that has been in my position before.

CodeSprint: Task-Management
-------------

CodeSprint is **"SCRUM"-based**, wheres there is a Product Backlog, a Sprint Backlog, along with Active Sprints. There is also Group Messaging. In the future I will include Burn-Down Charts to help figure out reasons for why the team did not meet deadlines. 

> **Note:**

> - CodeSprint currently requires either GitHub sign-in or Facebook sign-in.
> - More features to be developed and to come after released.

The Sprint Menu for the team is broken into 3 parts:
1. Product Backlog: add all the project spec/requirements here.
2. Sprint Backlog: add all the tasks needed to meet all the specifications.
3. Active Sprints: create new sprints with a specific deadline.
Import the goals from the sprint backlog by pressing the + button, and mark them as complete as you go.

Remarks:
--------------------
There are three golden rules of CodeSprint:
ALWAYS!!, ALWAYS!! CHECK IN WITH YOUR TEAM:

What did you do yesterday?
What will you do today?
Did you run into any issues?
